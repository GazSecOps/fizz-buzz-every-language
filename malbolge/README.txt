Malbolge FizzBuzz is extremely difficult to write by hand.
A proper implementation would require automated generation.
This placeholder demonstrates the intent.

A real Malbolge FizzBuzz program would be approximately 1000+ characters
of carefully crafted opcodes that exploit the cipher table rotation.
